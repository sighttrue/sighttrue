/**
 * What is for sale, and what never will be.
 *
 * The free tier is not a trial. Every reading this project publishes today —
 * every page, every JSON bundle, all seven MCP tools, the GitHub Action — stays
 * free permanently, and that is a product decision rather than generosity. The
 * credibility argument is that anybody can check any number, and a paywall in
 * front of the numbers destroys the only thing here that cannot be copied. The
 * MCP server is also listed in the official registry as free and keyless, and
 * quietly making that false would burn the best distribution this project has.
 *
 * So nothing that is free becomes paid. What is sold is the thing the free
 * version structurally cannot do: point the instrument at somebody else's list.
 *
 * The public watchlist is 388 repositories chosen by a stranger. Nobody wakes
 * up wanting to know their fork velocity. Everybody has forty dependencies they
 * have never checked, and the free stack checker already tells them what is
 * wrong with those today — in the browser, once, with no memory. The paid
 * product is memory: watch mine, and tell me when one of them changes.
 *
 * Every collector needed for that already exists and already runs. The marginal
 * cost of a paying customer is a few rows in a database and a handful of
 * requests that were going to be spent anyway.
