/**
 * Download and install counts from the package registries.
 *
 * Every endpoint here is free, unauthenticated, and run by somebody else. That
 * shapes the design more than anything: batch where a batch endpoint exists,
 * never retry in a tight loop, and treat a failure as a missing reading rather
 * than as an error worth stopping for. Nothing on this path is urgent.
 *
 * Verified against the live services before it was written, because
 * `free-tier-guard` treats limits as facts to check rather than estimates to
 * assume:
 *
 *   - npm answers up to 128 packages in one request and 400s at 129.
 *   - npm rejects scoped names in a batch; they must be fetched alone.
 *   - An unknown npm package comes back as null inside the batch rather than
 *     failing the whole request.
 *   - Homebrew publishes install counts for every formula as a single file.
 *   - crates.io refuses requests without a User-Agent.
 *
 * The whole watchlist costs roughly a hundred requests a day, against GitHub's
 * five thousand an hour. It is not close to anything.
