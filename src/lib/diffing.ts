 * rows already existed; `conform` fills a missing key with undefined; the
 * collector compared against that and announced a change for every repository
 * on the watchlist.
 *
 * The rule is one line and it is easy to forget, which is exactly why it should
 * not live in each collector's head:
 *
 *   undefined  never recorded — not comparable, say nothing
 *   null       recorded, and the value is absent — comparable
 *
 * A schema addition does not land on every row in one run either. The artefact
 * comes back for as long as any row predates the field, which is why the first
 * retraction missed 25 rows that a later pulse then produced.

 * added. Guarding on `undefined` alone is not enough: a row written before the
 * field existed is serialised with the key present and null — `undefined`
 * becomes null on the way to disk — so the next run reads a false "not
 * archived" that is really "never read". 22 rows in the live ledger are in
 * exactly that state.
 *
 * So the previous value has to be `false` itself. Nothing true is lost: a
 * genuine false-to-true is still a transition, and a row that has never been
 * read has not transitioned from anything.
