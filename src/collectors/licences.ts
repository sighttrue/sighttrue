/**
 * Relicensing, and going read-only.
 *
 * The only two signals here that need no threshold and have no false-positive
 * mode: a field either changed between two readings or it did not. Everything
 * else in this project is a judgement about magnitude that can be set wrong —
 * and four of five detectors currently sit above anything that happens.
 *
 * Both fields arrive in the repository payload the pulse already pays for six
 * times a day, and both were discarded until now. The marginal cost of this
 * collector is zero requests.
 *
 * Relicensing is rare and consequential in a way nothing else here matches.
 * HashiCorp, Redis, Elastic, MongoDB, Sentry and Terraform each moved off an
 * open licence; each time it dominated developer discussion for weeks and
 * forked the project. Nobody aggregates it.
 *
 * Pure. The diff is the whole collector.
