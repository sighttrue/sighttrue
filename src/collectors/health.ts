/**
 * Somebody else's assessment of a watched project.
 *
 * Two sources, both free and unauthenticated, and both verified against the
 * live services before this was written:
 *
 *   - deps.dev returns the OpenSSF Scorecard for a repository, keyed by the
 *     GitHub path rather than by a package name — so it covers the whole
 *     watchlist, including the 166 repositories that publish to no registry
 *     this project reads. Not every project has been scanned; unscanned is
 *     reported as unscanned.
 *   - OSV.dev answers advisories in batches. 267 mapped packages cost three
 *     requests, not 267.
 *
 * Neither figure is this project's judgement. Both are cited to the body that
 * made them, which is the only defensible way to publish a claim about someone
 * else's security posture.
