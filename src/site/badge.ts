/**
 * A badge per watched repository.
 *
 * The cheapest distribution this project has available. A maintainer who embeds
 * one puts a permanent link back in a README that may be read more in a week
 * than this site is read in a year — and it costs a static file.
 *
 * Which makes the wording load-bearing. A badge is quoted out of context by
 * definition: it appears on somebody else's page, with no caveats around it and
 * no way to click through to the disclosure. So it carries a figure that is
 * true standing alone, names its source, and makes no judgement at all. It says
 * what was measured, never whether that is good.
 *
 * SVG rather than a redirect to a badge service: no third party on somebody
 * else's README, nothing that can start charging, and nothing that can be taken
 * down and leave a broken image behind.
