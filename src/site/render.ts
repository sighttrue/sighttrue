    Every ${disclosure.cadenceHours} hours the agent reads ${watchlist.active} repositories and
    writes down what it sees. Nothing is inferred from a single reading. A repository's fork count
    is compared against that repository's own trailing average — never against another
    repository's — and a comparison is only made once there are
    ${disclosure.minBaselineDays} days of history to compare with. Before then the count is shown
    raw and marked forming, which means not measured yet rather than measured at zero.
  </p>
  <p>
    A threshold crossed once is <em>detected</em>. It becomes <em>confirmed</em> only if it is still
    true on the next day's reading. That costs a day of speed and buys the thing that cannot be
    bought back: fork counts are trivially inflatable with throwaway accounts, and a single
    observation cannot tell a real surge from a manufactured one.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sentences that interpret a reading are written by a language model, and are set in this typeface
    with a dashed edge so they never look like the measurements around them. Before publication
    every number in such a sentence is checked against the record it describes; if the model
    produced a figure that is not there, the sentence is discarded and a templated one is used
    instead. A sentence that is certainly true beats a fluent one that might not be.

    field as a whole.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>It does not measure quality, popularity or momentum.</strong> It measures fork counts,

    followed is in the record. That one caused the other is not, and is never claimed.

    index under Our record.
  </p>

    If a detector reads <em>never approached</em>, nothing has come within half its threshold across
    the whole window. That is not a statement about the repositories being watched. It is a
    statement that this instrument is set too high, and it is published because the alternative is
    asking readers to assume otherwise.
