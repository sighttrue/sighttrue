/**
 * Money, and the one attack this design has to survive.
 *
 * With no wallet connected there is no signature proving who controls the
 * sending address, so a form that takes a transaction hash will happily accept
 * a stranger's — copied off the block explorer, real, correct amount, correct
 * recipient, paid by somebody else. Every test here that matters is a variation
 * on that theft.
 *
 * The defence is that the invoiced amount carries a random tail bound to one
 * account, so a stolen hash fails on the amount rather than on an identity
 * check that cannot be made. If `wrong-amount` ever stops rejecting, this is
 * free money for anybody watching the chain.
