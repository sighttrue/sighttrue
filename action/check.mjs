/**
 * The dependency check, as a GitHub Action.
 *
 * This is the only distribution channel here that does not require anybody to
 * visit a website. A badge waits to be embedded and a page waits to be opened;
 * this runs in somebody's pipeline every day and speaks up when something they
 * depend on changes underneath them.
 *
 * It is also the only way to be a monitoring service at zero infrastructure
 * cost: the user's own CI is the scheduler, their own repository is the state,
 * and nothing here stores anything.
 *
 * Plain ESM with no dependencies, run by the Node that is already on every
 * runner. An action that needs `npm install` to tell you your dependencies are
 * risky has missed its own point.
 *
 * Failure policy: a network problem is not a finding. If the readings cannot be
 * fetched the step says so and passes, because a build that breaks when a
 * third-party site is down is a build nobody keeps. The same applies to posting
 * the review comment: a comment that cannot be posted is not a reason to fail
 * somebody's pipeline.
