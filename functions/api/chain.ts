/**
 * Can this deployment reach the chain.
 *
 * Payment verification reads a transaction receipt over JSON-RPC. If the
 * network path from a Worker to the chain does not exist, nothing downstream of
 * it can work, and finding that out when the first buyer is waiting is the
 * wrong time.
 *
 * It could not be answered from a laptop: the official RPC refused the
 * connection outright and the public Blockscout endpoint rate-limited a shared
 * address. Neither says anything about the path from Cloudflare's network,
 * which is the only path that matters, so the question is asked from there.
 *
 * Kept rather than thrown away. Once money depends on this, "is the chain
 * reachable" is an operational question somebody will ask again — during an
 * outage, after a provider change, when a payment does not land — and it should
 * have an answer that is one request away rather than a debugging session.
 *
 * Reads only. No key, no address, no state, nothing to spend.

 * these endpoints usable from here at all.
