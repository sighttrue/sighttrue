/**
 * A Model Context Protocol server over the published bundles.
 *
 * Coding agents now sit between a developer and most dependency decisions, and
 * they answer "is this package healthy" from training data that is a year old.
 * This lets them answer it from a reading taken today.
 *
 * It is the second public surface on this project and by far the safer of the
 * two. `/api/ask` holds an API key, calls a third party, and spends a quota
 * somebody could drain. This holds nothing, calls nothing but its own origin,
 * writes nothing, and has no quota to exhaust. The worst an abusive client can
 * do is read files that are already public at their own URLs.
 *
 * JSON-RPC 2.0 over the Streamable HTTP transport. Deliberately minimal: no
 * sessions, no server-initiated messages, no subscriptions. A stateless
 * request-response server is a complete MCP server for read-only data, and
 * every piece of state omitted is a piece that cannot go wrong.
 *
 * Every failure path returns a JSON-RPC error object. Nothing here throws to
 * the runtime, because a 500 from an MCP server presents to the agent as "the
 * tool is broken" rather than as "that argument was wrong".
